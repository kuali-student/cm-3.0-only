This code started out as a fork of Kuali Student ks-aggregate/trunk. Everything was imported imported except the contents
of the Impex MPX files which were very large. Those can be recreated by doing the manual impex procedure. It also contains
all of the commit history from Subversion.

A tag was created immediately after import called "Initial".

Subsequently, all code not related to Curriculum Management has been removed.
